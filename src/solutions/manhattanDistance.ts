* Manhattan Distance
*
* Distance function or metric of Euclidean geometry
* is replaced by a new metric in which the distance
* between two points is the sum of the absolute
* differences of their Cartesian coordinates.
*
* Pros: It's the quickest direct route to the point
* Cons: It doesn't take any of the environment into account
*
* Summary: It's quick but short lived
