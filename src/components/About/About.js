              Pathfinding is <Link href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/">
              "the problem of finding a good path from the starting point to the goalâ€•avoiding
              obstacles, avoiding enemies, and minimizing costs (fuel, time, distance, equipment,
              money, etc)" (Amit Patel)</Link>. A heurisitic funcition provides an estimated
              value of the cost for a step to the goal. It can be used to control the behaviour of
              the searching algorithm.

            <Paragraph>
              The goal is to move the snake across the cells to the point by returning a number
              from the <code>heuristic()</code> function. The function is called for every cell
              every time the snake needs to move, and is provided with information of the
              environment.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              The lowest number given for the 3 cells around the snakes head will be the next
              position the snake will take. If two cells have the same value, the first cell c
              lockwise from the top cell will be selected. Cells that are out of bounds and
              contain the snake are already excluded from selection.

            <Paragraph>
              To encourage minimizing costs, metrics for each point collection and the overall
              averages are fed into a rudementary scoring system. This will give an indication
              to how good your solution is.

              Solutions are temporary stored into local storage, but when authenticated
              with <Link href="https://github.com">GitHub</Link> they can be stored more
              perminantly. Once a valid solution has been saved, it can be submitted to the
              Leaderboard where it will be run against a similar environment.
