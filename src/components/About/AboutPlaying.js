          The goal is to move the snake across the cells to the point by returning a number
          from the <code>heuristic()</code> function. The function is called for every cell
          every time the snake needs to move, and is provided with information of the
          environment.

        <Text>
          The lowest number given for the 3 cells around the snakes head will be the next
          position the snake will take. If two cells have the same value, the first cell c
          lockwise from the top cell will be selected. Cells that are out of bounds and
          contain the snake are already excluded from selection.
